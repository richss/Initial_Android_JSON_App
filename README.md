This is a simple program that queries a PHP page via an HTTP_POST and receives a JSON string in reply.  This was my first personal attempt to directly interface to a website in Android.  Eventually, I will build out the functionality on other projects to develop some client/server features for my apps.  I also focused upon using all methods / classes available in API 22 (i.e. no depricated methods).
